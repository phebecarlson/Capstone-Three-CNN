Healthcare is an ever-evolving field on the precipice of using artificial intelligence to enhance the knowledge of doctors and assist in more rapid and effective treatment to promote a healthier and higher quality of life for people around the world.

A convoluted neural network was used to classify MRI imaging of brains to distinguish between healthy brains and scans with a tumor (of type glioma, meningioma, or pituitary). Image angles are not identical, with sagittal, coronal, and axial planes represented. The dataset is an amalgam of 3 other brain MRI datasets, contains over 7000 images, and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset?select=Training

Plenty of opportunity exists for deep learning to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment planning of diseases so that doctors can utilize their valuable time on the aspects of medicine that cannot be automated.
